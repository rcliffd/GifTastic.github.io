      <p>Hey Guys, first and foremost I want to thank the instructors and the opportunity to be apart of this boot camp. Im excited to learn this new skill, and take it to the next level for a new career. I have been living in the Milwaukee area for just under two years now. I am orginally from New Jersey, but have been living down south in the Carolinas for the past seven years. I currently have a Associates Degree in Business. In school I was focused on the complex of Golf Management, and was apart of the PGA Program focusing on being a Instructor. Since moving to Milwaukee I have taken a step back from the golf industry. Now excited for the next chapter in my career life!</p>
